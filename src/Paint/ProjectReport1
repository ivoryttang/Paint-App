# Paint Project Report #1

This app is allows the user to paint a picture with a wide array (>100) of color choices. The user can undo the last paint stroke and clear the frame to redraw.

### Buttons

Color: opens color chooser dialog box
Undo: undoes last stroke
Clear: clears whole frame

### Errors

The last stroke somehow comes back after clearing and drawing again. Likely some error in the paint method.

### Code Overview

DrawingArea.Java

	- paint method for color, undo, and clear button action

SwingPaint.java

	- initialize color chooser
	- initialize frame, content, control panel
	- create 3 buttons
	- adds action listener, mouse listeners


Line.java

	- helper class to store properties of lines drawn, including two coordinates between which line is drawn and line color


### Major Challenges

One major challenge I came across was getting the clear button to work because I was drawing using the Graphics g in paint method rather than the global variable g.
With a simple replacement of this.g, I got it to work.

### Acknowledgments

* Mr. Kuszmaul for indicating that I should try and use two for loops for the undo method to erase first, then redraw what you need. With more lines, this would be the quicker method.
